# Binary-Gap

The goal is to take in an integer and convert that integer into its binary representation. Then return the longest sequence of zeroes in between two 1's. This is known as the binary gap. For example, Integer 9 has a binary representation of 1001 which has a binary gap of 2. Integer 32 has a binary representation of 100000 which has a binary gap of 0.
